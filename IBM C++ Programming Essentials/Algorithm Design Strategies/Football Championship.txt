In the football championship, many teams are qualified with unique scores. The score of each team is stored in an array in sorted order. Assume, the array index represents the team. 
That is index 0 represents Team 1; index 1 represents Team 2 and so on. If a score is given, then one should find out which team got that score with an O(log n) time. 

Also, the code must display the mid scores (middle elements) in each iteration of the searching process.

Since Ronn wants to solve this puzzle with binary search, he decides to write a binary search himself. But he cannot remember the logic of binary search. Help Ronn to write the program.


Function signature :  int binarySearch(int[] ar, int size, int key)
This function is for performing the binary search operation and should display all the mid scores (midpoints) in each iteration of the search operation.  
This function should return the team number (position/index of the score in the array+1) if the specified score is found in the array.  If the key is not found, it should return -1.
