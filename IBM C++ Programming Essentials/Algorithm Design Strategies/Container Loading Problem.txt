Assume, there are N containers that need to be loaded into the ship. The capacity of the ship is W tons.  If weights of the N containers are given, find out the maximum number of containers that can be loaded into the ship.  Write a program in C++ to solve the problem.

Note:
Observe the highlighted output statements in the sample input and output statements for more clarifications.
Do not change the code template given.  Write your code in the provided places alone.
Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Input format:
The first line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to n.
The next n lines of the inputs consist of integers that correspond to the weights of the n containers [w1, w2,... wn].
The last line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to W.

Output format:
The first line of the output consists of a single integer that corresponds to the maximum number of containers that can be loaded into the ship.
The next line of the output corresponds to the solution vector.
