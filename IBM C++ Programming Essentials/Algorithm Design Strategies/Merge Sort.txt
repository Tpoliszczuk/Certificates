Implement Merge Sort using arrays. Apply Divide and Conquer algorithm design strategy to solve this. This strategy divides the input array into two halves until each half contains a single element and then merges these two sorted halves.

If the size of the array is less than or equal to 0 then print "Invalid array size" and terminate the program.

Functions to be used:
void mergeSort(int *arr, int low, int high) â€“ A function to split the array into two parts.
void merge(int *arr, int low, int high, int mid) - A function to merge the two half into sorted data.

Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample input statement 1:
Enter the size of an array:5                                                                                                                      
Enter the elements:

1                                                                               
2

6                                                                               

Sample output statement 1:
Given array is                                                                  
3 1 2 8 6                                                                                                                                                 

The sorted array is

Sample input statement 2:
Enter the size of an array:0                                                                                                      

Sample output statement 2:
Invalid array size
