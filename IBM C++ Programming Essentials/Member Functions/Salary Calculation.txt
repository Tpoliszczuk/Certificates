class Employee is created with the given private member variables as a part of the code skeleton.

int employeeId
string employeeName
double salary
double netSalary
Include appropriate public getters and setters methods in the Employee class.
getEmployeeId()
getEmployeeName()
getSalary()
getNetSalary()
setEmployeeId(int)
setEmployeeName(string)
setSalary(double)
setNetSalary(double)
The Net Salary, which is the amount an Employee receives at the end of a month, is the amount after deduction of Provident Fund contribution from Salary. The Provident Fund contribution is a Retirement/Pension Fund contribution. 

Write the following 'public' method in the Employee class:

void calculateNetSalary(int pfpercentage)  - This method should take PF percentage as an argument. Deduct the PF amount from the salary and set the netSalary.  

Formula:

netSalary = salary - ( salary * pfpercentage ) / 100;

Create a main() function that invokes the method 'calculateNetSalary' by passing the PF percentage as an argument and prints the details as shown in the sample Input/ Output. 

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input:
Enter Id:
101
Enter Name:
Vivek
Enter salary:
20000
Enter PF percentage:
7

Sample Output:

Id:101
Name:Vivek
Salary:20000
Net Salary:18600
