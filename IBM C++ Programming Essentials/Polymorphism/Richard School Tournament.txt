Richard School is organizing an inter-district sports tournament. The tournament contains several sports events such as Cricket, Carrom and Basketball. Calculate the score for a respective game using the function overloading concept in C++.

Note: Overload the function "calculateScore"

Cricket : 

Get three 'int' inputs from the user (number of sixers, number of fours and number of singles)
Score calculation  = (number of sixers * 6 )+ (number of fours * 4 )+ (number of singles)
Carrom :

Get 2 'int' inputs (number of white pockets, number of black pockets) and one 'bool' (if red pockets or not)input from the user
Score calculation = (number of white* 2 )+ (number of black* 1 ); If red pockets , add 5 points to the final score.
Basketball:

Get 2 'int' inputs (number of goals, number of fouls) from the user.
Score calculation = (number of goals ) - (number of fouls).
Note: Test the methods by invoking them in main method. Only business logic is tested in this question and not presentation. Refer the sample input / output to check the correctness of your code.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.
