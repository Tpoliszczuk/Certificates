Sean wants to play a number game with his son. He wants his son to find a 3-digit lucky code from the given set of numbers. A number is said to be lucky if the digit in the middle is 5 or 7.

Implement the logic in bool findMiddle(int num) method. If the condition is satisfied return true, else throw as runtime_error with an error message â€œNot a lucky codeâ€.

Note: Test the methods by invoking them in main method. Only business logic is tested in this question and not presentation. Refer the sample input / output to check the correctness of your code.

Do handle the exception from the main. Develop a C++ program using exception concepts. 

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:

Enter the number

157

Sample Output 1:

157 is a lucky code



Sample Input 2:

Enter the number

345

Sample Output 2:

Not a lucky code
