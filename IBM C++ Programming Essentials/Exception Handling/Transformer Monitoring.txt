Distribution Transformer is a critical equipment in  the power system. Therefore, monitoring of key parameters like voltage, current and temperature are necessary for evaluating the performance of a distribution transformer.

Implement the logic in string voltageTracker(float v1, float v2,float v3) method. 

If all the line voltage values lie between 240 and 250 V, return the string as "Safe voltage limit" from voltageTracker() method. 
If any of the voltage values lie between 251 and 275 V, return the string as "Warning voltage limit" from voltageTracker() method. 
If any of the voltage values exceed 275 V, throw an exception from voltageTracker() method with the message "Danger Detected Over Voltage".
Do handle the exception in the main method. Develop a C++ program to implement this functionality. 

Note: Test the methods by invoking them in main method. Only business logic is tested in this question and not presentation. Refer the sample input / output to check the correctness of your code.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.
