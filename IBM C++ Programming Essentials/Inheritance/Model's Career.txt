Helen is a top model and actress. She works in Advertisements and Movies. She needs a virtual assistant to help her to calculate total earnings. Help her with this by writing a C++ program.

Make a virtual assistant for her using Hierarchical Inheritance.

class Heroine with one protected attribute double earningsPerDay is created as a part of code skeleton.

Included getter and setter method for the above variable as a part of code skeleton.

Include the method with the name 'calcEarnings' has one parameter 'int noOfDays' with return type long.

Functionality: calcEarnings method must return total earnings.

Condition : totalEarnings = earningsPerDay * noOfDays;

Create a class MovieHeroine that inherits the properties of the class Heroine and has one attribute int daysRun (number of days the movie run) as private and override the calcEarnings  method.

Include appropriate getter and setter for the above attribute in MovieHeroine class as public.

Method with the name 'calcEarnings' has one parameter 'int noOfDays' with return type long.

Functionality: calcEarnings method has to return total earnings.

Condition : totalEarnings =  earningsPerDay * noOfDays

totalEarning=totalEarning+(totalEarning*extraPercentage/100)

If the daysRun is greater than 100, 10% extra from the total earning, if it is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 100 then 5% extra from the total earning, if it is less than or equal to 50 no extra percentage of amount.

Create a class AdvertisementModel that inherits the properties of the class Heroine and has one attribute int rating (rating for the advertisement) as private and override the calcEarnings  method.

Include appropriate getter and setter for the above attribute in AdvertisementModel class as public.

 Method with the name 'calcEarnings' has one parameter 'int noOfDays' with return type long.

Functionality : calcEarnings method has to return total earnings.

Condition : totalEarning=(earningsPerDay * noOfDays)+extraAmount

If the rating is above 5, then extra amount of 10000 will be added with the total earning, if the rating is less than 5 and greater than 2 then extra amount of 5000 will be added with the total earning and if the rating is less than 2 then no extra amount

Create a function main() to get input and print the output.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  

Sample Input 1:

Enter the earnings per day: 40000

Enter the number of days for movie: 34

Enter the number of days movie run: 100

Enter the number of days for advertisement: 20
