Flamingo Textiles, a firm that manufactures and markets dresses and shirts, would like to create an application. This application should display the garment price based on size. On festival seasons , they plan to give a 40% discount on all the dresses. Help them to create a C++ application using Multilevel Inheritance (Product, Dress, Shirt) concept.

A class Product contains the following attributes as protected:
int markedPrice - This attribute value is always 1000 dollars.
int discount - This attribute value is always 40 dollars.
Getter and setter methods are included for the above attributes as a part of code skeleton.

Create a class Dress and that  inherits the properties of the class Product.  Implement the method given below:
char findSize(int chestSize) -  This method has to return the size based on the chest size passed as an argument.
When chestSize is 20-30 => 'S'
When chestSize is 31 - 40 => 'M'
When chestSize is above 40 => 'L'
Create a class Shirt that inherits the properties of the class Dress and has the following method:
int calculatePrice(char chestSize) - This method has to return the calculated price.
Apply the discount to the marked price (markedPrice = markedPrice - ((markedPrice * discount)/100))
Add 1000 dollars to the markedPrice for large size dress 
Add 500 dollars to the markedPrice for medium size dress 
Create a function main() to test the application.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.
