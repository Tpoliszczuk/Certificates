John is appointed as the new Election Commissioner. He needs to make the election process easier and faster. To achieve these objectives, he needs an application to calculate the percentage of votes in all categories.

Develop an application using Single Inheritance in C++.

class Election  is created with the below three  protected attributes 

long int totalPeople 
long int noOfWomen 
long int noOfMen
Getters and setters are also provided as part of the code skeleton

Create a class GeneralElection and inherit the properties of class Election and implement the given methods as public:

1.      Method with name 'calcVotePercentage' has two parameters 'int partyA , int partyB' with return type double.

          Functionality : calcVotePercentage method has to calculate the vote percentage. People voted for two parties A and B, Some did not cast their votes. Calculate the vote percentage using the given formula,  ( ( (partyA+partyB) *100 ) /totalPeople)

2.      Method with the name 'calcWomenVotePercentage' has one parameter 'int womenVotes' with return type double.

         Functionality : calcWomenVotePercentage method has to calculate and return the vote percentage of  women, ((womenVotes*100) /noOfWomen) 

3.      Method with name 'calcMenVotePercentage' has one parameter 'int menVotes' with return type double. functionality : calcMenVotePercentage method has to calculate and return the vote percentage of men, ((menVotes*100) /noOfMen)

Create a function main() to get input and print the output as shown in the sample output.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.
