As part of better financial planning, Kim is calculating his monthly expenses for the months of November and December. Implement for the same in C++, using the operator overloading concept. 

A class MonthlyExpense with two private attributes household_exp and medical is already provided as a part of the code skeleton. Implement appropriate setters and getters.
double calculateNovemberMonthExpense() - Add household and medical expenses - calculate the total expense for November month and return it. 
double calculateDecemberMonthExpense() - Add household and medical expenses - calculate the total expense for December month and return it.

To overload the '+' operator, Implement the method : MonthlyExpense operator +(const MonthlyExpense expObj)
In this method, add November and December month household expenses & store the same in a new household expense variable. Also, add November and December medical expenses & store the same in a new medical expense variable and return that object.

Implement double calculateTotalExpense() method - In this method, calculate the total ( household + medical) expenses of two months (2 objects - November and December) and display it. 

Implement main() as given below:
Create a MonthlyExpense object and get November month's expense details (in $) and set the details using setters.
Calculate the total expense of November by invoking  the method calculateNovemberMonthExpense().
Create a MonthlyExpense object and get December month's expense details (in $) and set the details using setters.
Get the total expense of December by  invoking the method calculateDecemberMonthExpense().
Add November object and December object by using operator overloading concept (Overload the + operator).
Get the total expense by invoking calculateTotalExpense() method.
Note: Test the methods by invoking them in main method. Only business logic is tested in this question and not presentation. Refer the sample input / output to check the correctness of your code.

Note: Avoid the usage of exit(0) in your code.  
Sample Input 1:

Enter the House hold expense of November (in $) : 20000.00
